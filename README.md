IT1110 - Fundamental Informatics Practice Guide
The exercises focus on basic C programming concepts.
Overview
The practice sessions cover C programming fundamentals, including:

Basic input/output operations
Conditional statements (if, switch)
Loops (for, while, do...while)
Mathematical functions (math.h)
Arrays and string handling

Exercises are designed to be compiled and tested using Dev-C++.

Practice Sessions
Practice Session 2: Introduction to C Programming

Exercise 2.1: Write a program to add two floating-point numbers.
Exercise 2.2: Find the maximum of two floating-point numbers.
Exercise 2.3: Debug and fix a program to find the minimum of two floating-point numbers.
Exercise 2.4: Debug and fix a program to find the maximum of two floating-point numbers.
Exercise 2.5: Debug and fix a program to calculate the sum and average of three integers.

Practice Session 3: Mathematical Computations

Exercise 3.1: Calculate the sum and average of three subject scores (Math, Physics, Chemistry).
Exercise 3.2: Compute the circumference and area of a circle given its radius.
Exercise 3.3: Evaluate mathematical expressions with two floating-point inputs.
Exercise 3.4: Calculate the total price of tomatoes including tax.
Exercise 3.5: Evaluate a mathematical expression with three floating-point inputs.
Exercise 3.6: Compute a mathematical expression with two floating-point inputs.

Note: Use #include <math.h> for mathematical functions like sin, cos, sqrt, abs, and fabs.
Practice Session 4: Control Structures

Exercise 4.1: Calculate the factorial of a positive integer using a for loop.
Exercise 4.2: Check if a number is prime.
Exercise 4.3: Compute the sum of digits of a positive integer (< 1000) using a while loop.
Exercise 4.4: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers.
Exercise 4.5: Solve a quadratic equation, handling real and complex roots.
Exercises 4.6–4.8: Compute sums of series using while loops.
Exercises 4.9–4.12: Calculate nested square root expressions and other mathematical series.

Note: Use logical operators (&&, ||, !) and ensure proper parentheses in logical expressions.
Practice Session 5: Arrays and Strings

Exercises 5.1–5.7: Focus on array manipulation and string handling.
Array indices start at 0 (e.g., int a[3] has elements a[0], a[1], a[2]).
Use strcpy() for string assignment and strcmp() for string comparison.
Use fflush(stdin) before gets() for string input with spaces.
